1. The Contents or heads of the particulars are as followerh.

1. A Word of Exhortation by way of Preface to the following Purposes, from a Lover of the true interest of those to whom they are directed.

#####Body#####

1. A Lamentation over, and an Expostulation with the People of Scotland, for their so gain-standing and opposing the appearance of God among the Lord's People, called in derision Quakers; And for their foul Defection and Apostacy from what the primitive Protestants and Reformers were, (whose successors they boast themselves to be) yea and from what they have been but of late dayes themselves.

1. A Demonstration of the Apostacy and defection of the (so called) Church of Scotland, from what their Fathers, the Primitive Protestants, and Reformers were in Principles, to the number of 14. or 16. and in many practices also, wherein their Apostacy also and defection from what they have been themselves, but of late dayes in several particulars is hinted at, and there vile relapse into Popery (out of which they were never cleanly extricate) is discovered, and their treachery laid open in the matter of their Covenant which they cryed up as the glory of their Nation, and the concernment and interest of Iesus Christ, which now they have trampled under feet as the myre in the street, and think shame of it as if it had been awhores brat.

    _ POSTSCRIPT.

1. True and righteous Iudgement from the God of judgement, separating the precious from the vile, concerning the late proceedings of the people of Scotland in the matter of their Reformation from, and their covenanting against Prelacy, with the corruptions and popish Superstitions accompanying it; as also concerning their Church constitution, Ministry, Worship and Government, set up by them, after the pulling down of the former, and discrying it, as Antichristian, wherein likewise the Lords controversie with them in laying them by, and suffering this day to come over them, is shewed in which their building is also laid in the dust, and its the will of the Lord, that it never be again rebuilt.

1. The blessed long looked for day of God, broke up amongst us the Lords people called Quakers, with a declaration of the Lords loving kindness to us, and what he hath done for our Souls in causing the light of his countenance to shine on us.
